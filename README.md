What is CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)?

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a deep learning model mainly used to process images and visual data. It learns patterns directly from images, such as edges, shapes, textures, and objects, without manual feature engineering.

Why CNN is special

Traditional neural networks treat every pixel equally, but CNNs understand spatial relationships in images. This makes them extremely powerful for vision tasks.
